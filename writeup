Part 1: 2

Q1. Briefly explain the clock path from start to finish (crystal to SYSCLK), including explanations for all your major register configurations.

In this 72 MHz setup, the 16 MHz external oscilator feeds into OSC_OUT/_IN and is driven to 16 MHz by the HSE oscillator. The HSE oscilator outputs to the /2 prescaler chosen by the PLLXTPRE register, outputing a 8 MHz frequency. This feeds into the PLL, chosen by the PLLSRC register, which multiplies the 8 MHz clock by 9x (chosen by PLLMUL) to output a 72 MHz clock. This 72 MHz clock feeds into the main sysclk selector SW, which feeds PLLCLK to SYSCLK (instead of say the HSI).


Part 2: 3

Q2. Describe how you determined your PWM frequency.

Our PWM frequency was chosen as 36 kHz because, 1) it's an easy multiple of the 72 MHz Timer Frequency, 2) it's above the audible frequency [20-20000 Hz], 3) it's low enough that the PWM is high resolution. From the 72 MHz input clock to TIM3/4, we use no prescaler value (/1), and a period count of 2000, giving a PWM period frequency of 36 kHz.

Q3. Describe how you would calculate CCR1 values for motors off, %50, and %100.

The CCR1 values for each PWM is calculated based on the period frequency (2000 as described above).  For a given duty cycle (0% to 100%), the percentage is multiplied against the period of the PWM frequency.  This gives us the pulse width for which to turn on the motor.  Example calculations are presented below to demonstrate.
For motors, off, the CCR1 value should be
(0%/100)*2000 = 0
For 50%
(50%/100)*2000 = 1000
For 100%
(100%/100)*2000 = 2000
